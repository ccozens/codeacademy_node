# codeacademy_node
This repo contains tutorials and projects from codeacademy's nodejs course.

So far:

## Find your hat
Project to buildinteractive terminal game. The scenario is that the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field.

## API-postman
Project to build a small Express.js web API to store and serve different quotes about computers, coding, and technology. Project is actually called "Quote API" but I used it for [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) practice, hence the name.

## Boss Machine
Larger project to build an entire API to serve information to a Boss Machine (ie to serve fake employee information to a front end). This came with optional additional steps and optional tests. Currently 61/61 tests pass.
